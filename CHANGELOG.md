- Internal improvements.


## 3.10.0

- New feature: you can choose what anilist manga to link by pressing <kbd>a</kbd> in the manga chapters list.
  TUI mode only. This will affect what metadata is downloaded for the manga and what manga would be marked as read on your anilist profile.
- Pressing <kbd>enter</kbd> on the chapter will now open it for reading if other chapters aren't selected.
  Can be disabled with `mangal config set -k tui.read_on_enter -bv false`
- The chapter selection page now shows which manga from the anilist it is linked to.
  Can be disabled with `mangal config set -k anilist.link_on_manga_select -bv false`

  Can be changed with `mangal config set -k tui.item_spacing -iv 1` (1 is default)

  To disable: `mangal config set -k tui.show_downloaded_path -bv false`
- Option to reverse order of the chapters in the TUI. `mangal config set -k tui.reverse_chapters -bv true` to enable
- Reduce the size of the compiled binary by removing unused lua libraries. May break some lua scripts, but I don't think you were using AWS to scrape manga :)

## 3.9.1

- Fix version comparison mechanism for `update` command.
  Now it compares each fragment separately (major, minor, patch) instead of comparing two versions as strings lexicographically.

## 3.9.0

- New sources: [Mangakakalot](https://mangakakalot.com) & [Mangapill](https://mangapill.com)
- Fix termux installation detection by [@2096779623](https://github.com/2096779623) #94
- Change the way `mangal update` works.
  If mangal wasn't installed via package manager it will get the current location of running binary and replace it with the new one.
  Previously it was assumed that mangal was installed in `/usr/local/bin` which is not always the case.
  Doesn't work on Termux yet because it requires specific variation of Go compiler which is troublesome to configure with automatic release system that mangal uses.
  Will be fixed in the future.
